### Missing Dog
```DISCLAIMER: no real dogs are missing - do not worry```

Your friend's aunt Clarence runs a dog hotel. Good for her the business grows
and more and more dog owners leave their dogs there going for holidays.
Good for you because when Clarence heard you are good at *computer stuff*
she asked for help with creating a computer registry
that would replace her old notebook registry version.
However, the advantage of a notebook is that is does not break down, so
your code must handle situations when the registry search criteria are not met -
and where there should be a dog, there is none.


In this project, your primary goal is to get familiar with **Optional API** as well as
review and practice the usage of **Stream API**. Three classes need method implementation.

Run unit tests to see if your implementation is correct.
Focus on handling potential null pointers in given data and use Streams to finish this project.

**IMPORTANT**: Optional API serves many purposes
so several correct implementations are possible.
Do not stick with one solution, try to play around with as many methods as possible.
